# PythonChat 2019

This project began as a academic assignment for Networking, Spring 2018, Principia College. It has continued to be updated by Andrew Christianson as a fork of the original with almost all previous code removed. Updates have included the addition of a TKinter GUI from the previous Windows command console version, refactoring of code structure, addition of view and reciever classes, and changes in threading in both Server and Client classes. This project also now follows a Model-View-Controller structure with different directories for Client and Server files.
